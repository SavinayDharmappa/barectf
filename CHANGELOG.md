# barectf 2 changelog

## barectf v2.1.1

**Bug fixes**:

  * Force clock offset object properties to their default values when
    set to `null`

**README.md**:

  * Update Babeltrace's URL
  * Add `--python=python3` option to virtualenv line in the
    testing section


## barectf v2.1.0

**Features**:

  * Add `$include` property to metadata, clock, trace, stream, and
    event objects to [include external YAML files](https://github.com/efficios/barectf/wiki/Including-external-YAML-files)
  * Object properties which have a default value can force it
    with `null`; this is especially useful when also using type
    inheritance or including external YAML files

**Bug fixes**:

  * Fix a few error messages
  * Use appropriate prefix for event context type parameters in
    generated code
  * `_write_cstring()`: use prefix
  * Enumeration type object: start from current last value when
    adding label-only members to parent object
  * Check the size of the `id` (event header) and `stream_id`
    (packet header) to make sure they can fit all events/streams
  * Reduce the number of compiler warnings when using `-Wall` and
    `-pedantic`
  * Make sure all entity types are structure types
  * Make sure all enumeration type object member values fit within
    the enumeration's value type
  * Check for unknown properties in enumeration type object
  * Check for unknown properties in floating point number size object
  * Check for unknown `base` values in integer type object
  * Check the type of the `byte-order` property in trace object
  * Check the signedness of the `uuid` field's element type in the
    trace packet header type
  * Check for unknown properties in configuration object
  * Check node type before checking its properties
  * Use unions to write floating point numbers to avoid aliasing warnings

**Tests**:

  * Add configuration file tests

**README.md**:

  * Add CI badge
  * Add C99 compliance limitation
  * Move documentation to the project's wiki

## barectf v2.0.0

Initial release.

Major changes from barectf 0.x:

  * Single YAML configuration input
  * TSDL metadata is generated by barectf instead of being consumed
  * Introduction of platforms to handle buffers automatically with
    custom callbacks and to allow continuous tracing
  * Various optimizations in the generated C code
